# NFL-data-ETL
Two data sources for NFL data were used for this ETL exercise.
Using kaggle I downloaded two CSV files.
These files were relatively clean so I only created a data frame to minimize the columns I thought were important.
Using Postgres and SQL Alchemy I created the two tables to load my data.
Data tables were related so using standard SQL with Postgres made the most sense if I were to analyze the data.
